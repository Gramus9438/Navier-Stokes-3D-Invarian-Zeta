# Data — Example Results

This folder stores **CSV files** generated by simulations or provided as examples.  

Each CSV must follow the same column convention:

t, energy, enstrophy, helicity, H12, zeta

## 📂 Included Files

- **`taylor_green_demo.csv`**  
  A **synthetic example dataset** provided for demonstration and testing.  
  It mimics the typical output of a Taylor–Green vortex run, with smooth decay of energy and bounded ζ(t).  
  ⚠️ This file is *not* from a real simulation — it is only for visualization demos in notebooks.

---

## 🚀 Usage in Notebooks

1. Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb`  
2. Set:

```python
CSV_PATH = "../data/taylor_green_demo.csv"

3. Run the cells → plots for ζ(t) and energy will appear immediately.

📌 Notes

Real data should be generated by running simulations (scripts/run_case.py or scripts/bench_all.py).

Only lightweight CSVs (demo or selected runs) should be committed to Git.

Larger benchmark outputs go into 📁 artifacts/ with automatic subfolders.
