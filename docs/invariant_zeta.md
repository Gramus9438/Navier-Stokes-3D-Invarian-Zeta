# Invariant Î¶(t)

##  Background

The threeâ€“dimensional incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations are one of the **Millennium Prize Problems** posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.  
The central question is whether, for all smooth initial data with finite energy, the solutions remain **regular for all time**, or whether **finiteâ€“time singularities** may occur.

##  Innovation: the Î¶(t) Invariant

We introduce a new invariant, denoted **Î¶(t)**, designed to provide global control of solution growth:

$$
\zeta(t) = \sqrt{ \, \|u(t)\|_{H^{1/2}}^2 + \beta \, \|\omega(t)\|_{L^2}^2 \, }
$$

where:

- \(u(t)\) is the velocity field,  
- \(\omega = \nabla \times u\) is the vorticity field,  
- \(\|u\|_{H^{1/2}}\) is the critical Sobolev norm,  
- \(\beta > 0\) is a tunable parameter.

##  Theoretical Motivation

1. **Coupling critical scales**: Î¶(t) links the critical Sobolev regularity \(H^{1/2}\) with vorticity intensity.  
2. **Singularity prevention**: the boundedness of Î¶(t) prevents finiteâ€“time blowâ€“up of energy or enstrophy.  
3. **Theoryâ€“numerics bridge**: unlike abstract invariants, Î¶(t) is **computable in simulations**, making it verifiable.  
4. **Consistency with known results**: the Sobolev space \(H^{1/2}\) is known as critical for Navierâ€“Stokes; Î¶(t) introduces a new dynamic coupling with vorticity.

## ðŸ“Š Numerical Validation

The Î¶(t) invariant is monitored in all our 3D pseudoâ€“spectral simulations.  
The benchmark test cases include:

- **Classical flows**: Beltrami (ABC), Taylorâ€“Green, Lambâ€“Oseen.  
- **Pathological flows**: vortex filaments, rough \(H^{1/2}\)â€“type initial data.  
- **Jets and shear layers**: unstable profiles generating strong gradients.  
- **Multiâ€“scale superpositions**: smallâ€“scale excitations and nonlinear interactions.  

In all these cases, Î¶(t) remains bounded and exhibits regular evolution.

---

##  Expected Impact

- If Î¶(t) is **mathematically proven** to remain bounded, it provides a **proof of global regularity** for the 3D Navierâ€“Stokes equations.  
- It becomes a **universal diagnostic** that can be verified by any researcher.  
- It establishes a framework for **reproducible mathematics**: the theory is accompanied by openâ€“source, numerically validated code.
